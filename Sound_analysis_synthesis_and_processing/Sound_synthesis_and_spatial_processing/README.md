## Abstract

**Wave Digital Filters** (WDFs) are a type of a digital filter designed using principles from analog filter theory, specifically wave scattering and transmission lines. They translate analog filter circuits into digital counterparts, preserving properties like stability and passivity. This assignment requires to model the clipping stage of a famous distortion guitar pedal (*the MXR Distortion+*) in the Wave Digital domain, starting from a reference analog circuit.
