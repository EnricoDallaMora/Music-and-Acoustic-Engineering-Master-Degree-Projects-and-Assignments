## Abstract

In this study the functioning of a grand piano is examined and approximated through the study of its parts. From the transverse vibration of a damped string a force is transmitted to the harmonic plate which will vibrate and radiate sound. All these steps are discussed in depth, concluding with the *sound pressure level* radiation pattern obtained interpolating the acoustic radiation at 10 microphone positions. The SPL is determined evaluating the *kirchhoff-helmholtz integral*.
