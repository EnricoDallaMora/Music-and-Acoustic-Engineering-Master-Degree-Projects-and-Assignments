## Abstract

Dynamics of a *1-degree of freedom* system and an *n-degrees of freedom* system. *Equation of motion, free motion, forced motion, modal study* and *FRF matrix* of the systems are evaluated. Subsequently, a third system is examined. *Natural frequencies, damping ratios* and *mode shapes* of the resonating modes are determined from a given dataset of forces and displacements collected from a *dynamometric test*.
