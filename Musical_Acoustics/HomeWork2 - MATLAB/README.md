## Abstract

This report discusses *thin plate-string interaction*. Quasi-longitudinal, longitudinal and bending waves propagation speed are derived, together with frequencies of the first six vibrational modes. A brief discussion on *x-modes* and *ring modes* is conducted before the characterization of the coupling. Strong and weak coupling conditions are analyzed and the resulting resonant frequencies are determined from dispersion curves.
