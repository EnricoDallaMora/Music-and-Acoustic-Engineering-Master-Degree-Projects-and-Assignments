## Abstract

This report analyzes the sound synthesis of the Martin D28 guitar by modeling the vibrational interaction between the strings and body. Using a simplified two-mass system, the bridge impedance was calculated to represent how string vibrations transfer energy to the guitar top plate. MATLAB Simulink simulations provided resonance frequencies and sound response data, showing how plucking position and bridge impedance affect guitar acoustics.
